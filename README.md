## Description

This project was created to showcase my front-end development skills,
emphasizing modern HTML and CSS techniques. It features a clean, fully
responsive design, using best practices like semantic HTML, modular CSS, and
JavaScript for dynamic interactions. The website includes key sections like a
hero landing page, an "About Us" introduction, services and pricing information,
a booking form, and a gallery of work, all optimized for usability across
devices.

The main objective was to demonstrate my ability to build a professional website
using advanced CSS (flexbox, grid), JavaScript for interactivity, and the AOS
library for smooth animations. This project serves as a portfolio piece to
highlight my expertise in crafting responsive, maintainable, and visually
engaging web pages.

## Features

  consistent user experience on all devices.
- **Interactive Elements**: Enhanced user engagement with smooth animations
  powered by `AOS` and JavaScript-driven interactions.
- **Carousel in Hero Section**: The hero section features a JavaScript-powered
  carousel, providing users with an engaging visual experience by smoothly

  to improve performance, ensuring that images load only when they are needed,
  resulting in a faster user experience.

  techniques like flexbox and grid for layout.
